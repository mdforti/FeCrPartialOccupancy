The obtained results suggest linear correlation between bulk modulus and Re concentration and between shear modulus and formation enthalpy. The results are used to parameterize a sublattice model with ideal mixing on each sublattice for the free energy and elastic constants. The model allows one to predict the equilibrium composition on each sublattice and hence elastic constants as a function of global Re concentration and temperature of the W-Re alloy.},

Experimental values of polycrystalline isotropic elastic moduli for these materials are presented here, and the validity of the VRH approximation is established. The VRH approximation is then discussed for these materials with respect to their elastic anisotropy of crystals. To provide further support to this work, a numerical confirmation on the VRH moduli is made with the use of a high‐speed computer by calculating the mean velocity of sound in crystals and comparing this result with the corresponding quantity calculated from the actual polycrystalline elastic moduli. The general agreement is observed.},

	abstract = {Tungsten (W) is a leading candidate for plasma-facing materials in fusion reactors. Recently, experiments have shown that during neutron irradiation, W and its transmutation products, mainly rhenium (Re), will form precipitates of the σ and χ types. This study identifies close-packed planes of the σ- and χ-phases in the W-Re system and uses ab-initio methods to identify mechanical properties such as elastic constants, generalized stacking fault energies (GSFE), and fracture toughness associated with brittle and ductile mechanisms. By utilizing a sublattice model we demonstrate how these properties depend on the Re content. For Re concentrations in the range where the σ- and χ-phases are stable, we find a weak dependency on the Re content, meaning that the elemental composition has little influence on the mechanical and fracture-related properties.},

In the present study, an off-equiatomic Cr26Mn20Fe20Co20Ni14 high-entropy alloy was solutionized and isothermally aged at temperatures between 600 °C and 1000 °C for times to 1000 h. In the original single-phase fcc matrix, an intermetallic σ phase was found to form at all investigated temperatures. Its morphology and composition were determined and the precipitation kinetics analyzed using the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov equation and an Arrhenius type law. From these analyses, a time-temperature-transformation diagram (TTT diagram) is constructed for this off-equiatomic alloy. We combine our findings with theories of precipitation kinetics developed for traditional polycrystalline fcc alloys to calculate a TTT diagram for the equiatomic CrMnFeCoNi HEA. The results of our investigation may serve as a guide to predict precipitation kinetics in other complex alloys in the Cr-Mn-Fe-Co-Ni system.},

Like the LAPW method it can be used to treat first-row and transition-metal elements with affordable effort and provides access to the full wave function. The augmentation procedure is generalized in that partial-wave expansions are not determined by the value and the derivative of the envelope function at some muffin-tin radius, but rather by the overlap with localized projector functions. The pseudopotential approach based on generalized separable pseudopotentials can be regained by a simple approximation.},

	abstract = {Elastic properties play a key role in materials science and technology. The elastic tensors at any order are defined by the Taylor expansion of the elastic energy or stress in terms of the applied strain. In this paper, we present ElaStic, a tool that is able to calculate the full second-order elastic stiffness tensor for any crystal structure from ab initio total-energy and/or stress calculations. This tool also provides the elastic compliances tensor and applies the Voigt and Reuss averaging procedure in order to obtain an evaluation of the bulk, shear, and Young moduli as well as the Poisson ratio of poly-crystalline samples. In a first step, the space-group is determined. Then, a set of deformation matrices is selected, and the corresponding structure files are produced. In a next step, total-energy or stress calculations for each deformed structure are performed by a chosen density-functional theory code. The computed energies/stresses are fitted as polynomial functions of the applied strain in order to get derivatives at zero strain. The knowledge of these derivatives allows for the determination of all independent components of the elastic tensor. In this context, the accuracy of the elastic constants critically depends on the polynomial fit. Therefore, we carefully study how the order of the polynomial fit and the deformation range influence the numerical derivatives, and we propose a new approach to obtain the most reliable results. We have applied ElaStic to representative materials for each crystal system, using total energies and stresses calculated with the full-potential all-electron codes exciting and WIEN2k as well as the pseudo-potential code Quantum ESPRESSO.},
